***READ ME FILE***

All main files name "module#". You can launche them through terminal or any other program.
This folder contains already with files that using in "module#"'s files to launch it.
There is no need to uncomment anything, all neccessary code is ready to get launch. 
The modules work and operate separately from the each other.
All .py files was checked by Anaconda, Terminal and VS launch. 
As well as was updated path for the files, so now they need to be just in same faulder as .py file.
Thank you for the attention.
