All main files name "module#". You can launche them through terminal or any other program.
This folder contains already with files that using in "module#"'s files to launch it.
There is no need to uncomment anything, all neccessary code is ready to get launch. 
Except in Module2: 
    # Print the response data
print("Print the response data: ")
#print(data)
print()

If it's not commented all the next data won't be proceed correctly.

The modules work and operate separately from the each other.
