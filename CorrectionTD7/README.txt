***READ ME FILE***

All main files name "TD7". You can launche them through terminal or any other program.
Each folder contains already with files that using in TD7's files to launch it.
There is no need to uncomment anything, all neccessary code is ready to get launch. Also, search is based on Reddit posts.
The first part works and operates separately from the second.
For p1 - there is only output, with matrix, etc. I surtenly sure, there is some mistakes with calculation,
but I couldn't process them. 
For p2 - after launching the program you will see the theme (subbreddit) in which will be provided for search.
In this case It is very important which theme you want to choose. Eg:
*The theme is "computerscience" and the post number is 100, keyword is "ai".
*The theme is "logistics" and the post number is 300, keyword is "truck".
*The theme is "all" and post number is 20, keyword is "love".
In this case it is important to note that the search language is English. 
Also, the keyword should match a given subject, i.e., if you are looking for computers, then within the relevant subject. 
Common words such as "love," "food," "water," (love, food, water) search in the general ("all") section. 
The number of posts that are defined also affects the search. A greater number, respectively more matches will be found.
All .py files was checked by Anaconda, Terminal and VS launch. 
Thank you for the attention.

P.S. You can find folder p2 extra updates - there is more modificated version of p2, that allows you to fill in such main 
search filters as number of posts, subbreddit and, of course, word to search. Word-search same as in main p2. Also,
the more number of posts the more chances to get match. Just try different words. Thank you.
